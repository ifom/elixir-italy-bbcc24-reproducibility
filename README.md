## IMDB dataset
Data in the imdb/ folder were obtained from the IMDB official data repository and further processed to be used as a quick interactive session in a Jupyter notebook. The original data were too big to be used directly and they have been reduces and cleaned. 

These are the data files needed for the exercise:
- small_title_basics.csv.zip (compressed csv file) is in /imdb folder
- title_ratings.tsv (original tsv file) is in /imdb folder
- small_title_principals.csv.zip (compressed csv file) can be downloaded from this url: https://drive.google.com/file/d/1Y_8sTSlIr2m33KlOQojGrGBDb0r8cFPI/view?usp=sharing
